<i>So, who is Robbie Williams?</i>

6
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,415
<i>Well, I've been called many things -</i>

7
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,374
<i>narcissistic, punchable,shit-eating twat,</i>

8
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,415
<i>but while I'm all those things,</i>

9
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,124
<i>I wanna show you
how I really see myself.</i>

[Robbie VO]
<i>1982, Stoke-on-Trent.</i>

14
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,374
<i>The arse-end of the
north of England.</i>

15
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,749
[boy 1] Mitchell.

16
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,082
<i>It may look grubby
and deprived...</i>

17
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,415
- [boy 2] Troy.
<i>- But deep down...</i>

18
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,040
- [boy 1] Wayne.
<i>- it was grubby and deprived.</i>

19
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,040
[boy 2] Mason.

20
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,165
<i>I didn't have much,</i>

21
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,499
<i>but at least
I had the respect...</i>

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,124
- [boy 1] Crystal.
<i>- and admiration of my peers.</i>

23
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,332
[Robbie] What?!

24
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,124
[Robbie VO] <i>They just had
trouble showing it.</i>

25
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,624
- [boy 2] Robert.
- Yes! Come on! [Grunts]

26
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,540
Oi! Right, knobhead,
pass the ball to Nate

27
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,915
and let him do the rest.

28
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,082
Positions!

29
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,624
Oi! The fuck you off to?
You're in goal.

30
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,332
- But...
- Don't fuck it up.

31
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,540
I'm like a chainmail condom,
nothing's getting through.

32
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,415
Whoo! Let's go, slags!

33
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,374
[Robbie VO]
<i>I had plenty of balls.</i>

34
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,582
<i>But I couldn't stop
a single one.</i>

35
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,790
I wasn't ready. Ohh!

36
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,540
- [boy] Nice one, dickhead.
- Come on!

37
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,957

[thudding] [children laughing]

41
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,333
[boy] You really are fucking
useless, aren't ya?

42
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,166
[children laughing]

43
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,916
[girl] Little bitch!

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,207
It's alright, Rob.

45
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,165
Nate, just leave it.

46
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,207
Yeah... Yeah, jog on, you tit.

47
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,875
- [children laughing]
- Right, come on, let's go.

48
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,874
You're a fucking nobody!

49
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,416
[sniffles]

50
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,915
